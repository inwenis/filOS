TODOs:
i think CPU should have access to memory, maybe not now but in the future
compile instrucitons and give the cpu compilled instrucitons,
    compiled instructions should be used almost everywhere
comments from OS.cs:
    //copy instruction to memory
    //instruction pointer (relative, since process is running in "user mode", cpu will be aware of the currently running process)
    //memory mapping
    //save process in process list/etc
